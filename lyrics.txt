Let's get down to business
To outbid the Huns
Here I have some figures
And some facts and sums!

It's the saddest lot you've ever bought
But if you bet on this one too
Mister, I'll make you a buck
Or two

Business man
We must be swift as the stock exchanges
Business man
With all the force of a great tycoon
Business man
With all the strength of a thriving market
Mysterious as my company's revenues
